### Basic Settings
- **Enable blinking**: Toggle caret blinking animation. When disabled, the caret remains constantly visible.

### Animation Settings
- **Animation smoothness** (5-30%): Controls how smooth the caret movement is. Lower values create smoother animations, while higher values make the movement more direct.

- **Catch-up speed** (30-80%): Determines how quickly the caret catches up during normal typing. Higher values make the caret more responsive but less smooth.

- **Max catch-up speed** (50-100%): Sets the maximum speed for catching up during fast typing. This ensures the caret doesn't fall too far behind during rapid input.

- **Adaptive speed**: When enabled, automatically adjusts animation speed based on typing speed.

### Default Values
- Animation smoothness: 15%
- Catch-up speed: 50%
- Max catch-up speed: 80%
- Adaptive speed: Enabled
- Blinking: Enabled
